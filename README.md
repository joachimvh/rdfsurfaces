# RDF Surfaces

The RDF Surfaces sets out to create a sublanguage of [Notation3](https://w3c.github.io/N3/spec/)
in order to implement classical first-order logic with negation in RDF as envisioned by Pat Hayes
in his 2009 ISWC Invited Talk: [BLOGIC](https://www.slideshare.net/PatHayes/blogic-iswc-2009-invited-talk).

See the living document [RDF Surfaces Primer](https://w3c-cg.github.io/rdfsurfaces/).
